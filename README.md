# Flight booking system
# ðŸ‘‹ Introduce
    -- THE PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

-- This project is for preparing my graduation thesis, utilizing Vue.js with Nuxt.js and .NET for development. 

_I chose Vue.js to learn and build a Single-Page Application (SPA) because it is easier for beginners._

-- Flight booking system with B2B and B2C model.

-- There are three user levels within the ticket booking system: User, Agent, and Administrator.
 - Users have basic permissions in the ticket booking system, they can search for the desired destination, choose a seat, and make a payment in one click.
 - Agents are users who can manage the functionality and have access to all features within the system.
 - Administrator is able to manage every aspect of the system, has visibility to all features and changes system settings.
